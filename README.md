# Time Management Software

This project generates a university timetable by running a pipeline of Python constraint solvers and Node.js helper scripts. It resolves timetables for the 3rd, 5th, and 7th semesters sequentially, then generates PDF and DOCX files from the final result.

## Features

* **Modular Solver Pipeline:** Solves 3rd, 5th, and 7th-semester timetables in order, using the output of one as the input for the next.
* **Conflict Diagnostics:** Includes Python scripts to analyze and report conflicts or unavailability issues in the data.
* **Multiple Exports:** Generates `timetable.pdf` and `Timetable.docx` files from the final solved JSON.
* **Web Viewer:** A simple `index.html` is included to browse the final `updated_timetable.json` by day.

## Folder Structure

* **/data/**: Contains all input and configuration files.
    * `config.json`: The main configuration for all solvers (sections, subjects, rooms, etc.).
    * `data.json`: The base timetable skeleton. This is the **input** for the 3rd-semester solver.
    * `not-available.json`: Teacher unavailability constraints.
    * `raw_inputs/`: (Optional) Holds the original data files used by `scripts/data_generator.js`.
* **/outputs/**: All files generated by the pipeline are saved here.
* **/src/**: The main Python source code, structured as a package.
    * `/solver/`: Contains the individual solvers for each semester.
    * `/diagnostics/`: Contains scripts to test and validate data *before* running the solvers.
* **/scripts/**: Contains all helper scripts written in Node.js (e.g., data generation, exports).
* **/web_viewer/**: A standalone HTML/CSS/JS viewer for the final `updated_timetable.json`.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-  **Python 3.8+** ([Download & Install](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

-  **Node.js 16+** ([Download & Install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))

---

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Goutam-04/Time-Management-Software.git
    cd Time-Management-Software
    ```

2.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

---

## How to Run

You can run the entire pipeline from start to finish using the provided scripts.

### On Linux/macOS

```bash
# Make the script executable (only need to do this once)
chmod +x generate.sh

# Run the full pipeline
./generate.sh

```

### On Windows

```
# Run the full pipeline
generate.bat

```

### What This Script Does:

1.  **Cleans** any old files from the `outputs/` directory.

2.  **Runs the Python solver pipeline:**

    1.  `src/solver/solver_3rd.py` (Reads `data/data.json`, writes to `outputs/updated_timetable.json`)

    2.  `src/solver/solver_5th.py` (Reads `outputs/updated_timetable.json`, overwrites it)

    3.  `src/solver/solver_7th.py` (Reads `outputs/updated_timetable.json`, overwrites it)

3.  **Runs the Node.js export scripts:**

    -   `scripts/export_to_pdf.js` (Reads `outputs/updated_timetable.json`, writes to `outputs/timetable.pdf`)

    -   `scripts/export_to_doc.js` (Reads `outputs/updated_timetable.json`, writes to `outputs/Timetable.docx`)

4.  **Prepares the Web Viewer:**

    -   Copies the final `outputs/updated_timetable.json` into the `web_viewer/` folder so it can be loaded by the page.

### Viewing the Results

-   **JSON, PDF, DOCX:** All final files are in the **/outputs/** folder.

-   **Web Viewer:** Open the **`web_viewer/index.html`** file in your browser to see the interactive timetable.

Running Diagnostics (Optional)
------------------------------

If the solver fails (especially the 7th-semester one), it's often due to a conflict in the input data. You can run the diagnostic scripts to find issues:

Bash

```
# Run the main conflict diagnostics
python3 src/diagnostics/diagnose_conflicts.py

# Run the specific unavailability checker
python3 src/diagnostics/test_unavailability.py

```

These scripts will read `data/config.json` and `data/data.json` and print any teacher or room conflicts they find.
